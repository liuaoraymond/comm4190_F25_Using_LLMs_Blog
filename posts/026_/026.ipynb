    "## What Went Wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train Dates Were Wrong\n",
    "ChatGPT suggested specific trains and departure times. When I checked the actual JR schedules, half the trains didn't run on those dates or times.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would've missed connections if I'd trusted the itinerary blindly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It Missed My Vibe Completely\n",
    "**What I wanted:** Tadao Ando buildings, small design shops, local izakayas recommended by residents\n",
    "\n",
    "**What ChatGPT gave me:** Tokyo Skytree, Senso-ji Temple, Tsukiji Fish Market - all mainstream tourist spots\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendations weren't *wrong*. They just weren't *mine*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Culinary Suggestions Were Generic\n",
    "ChatGPT recommended well-known ramen chains and Michelin-starred restaurants. Nothing niche. Nothing local.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I asked for \"hidden gem food spots,\" it gave me places with 10,000+ Google reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Outputs Were Overwhelming\n",
    "Each day had 8-10 activities listed with paragraph descriptions. Reading through it felt like homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "I couldn't see the flow of the trip. Just a wall of text with too many options.\n"

    "## What Actually Worked\n",
    "\n",
    "I ended up using:\n",
    "\n",
    "**TikTok and YouTube:** Locals and frequent travelers showing actual spots. I found a tiny coffee shop in Kyoto that specializes in architecture books, a hidden kaiseki restaurant in Osaka, and a design district ChatGPT never mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Google Maps + Word of Mouth:** I searched for \"architecture\" near areas I was already visiting. User reviews from real people who'd been there recently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Travel blogs by residents:** Japanese design blogs and expat food guides gave me the niche spots AI couldn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manual train checking:** I verified every train route on the actual JR website. Time-consuming but necessary.\n"

    "## Why AI Itinerary Planning Failed\n",
    "\n",
    "### It Optimizes for Popularity, Not Preference\n",
    "ChatGPT recommends places that appear frequently in its training data - which means tourist-heavy spots dominate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Niche recommendations require local knowledge AI doesn't have.\n",

    "### It Can't Verify Real-Time Information\n",
    "Train schedules change. Restaurants close. Events get canceled. AI doesn't know this.\n",
    "\n",
    "It generates confident answers based on outdated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It Doesn't Understand \"Vibe\"\n",
    "I can tell ChatGPT I like \"architecture and design,\" but it can't distinguish between:\n",
    "- A famous building everyone photographs\n",
    "- A quiet neighborhood with innovative residential projects\n",
