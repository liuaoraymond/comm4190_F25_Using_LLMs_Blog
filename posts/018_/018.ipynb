    "\n",

    "- It implies existential stakes.\n",
    "- It normalizes urgency over deliberation.\n",
    "- It positions being second as failure.\n",
    "- It pushes policymakers toward reactionary speed.\n",

    "- use metrics as PR tools,\n",
    "- cherry-pick tests,\n",
    "- ignore safety dimensions that are hard to measure.\n",

    "Chapter 5 argues strongly for testing as the engine of progress—and as a viable alternative to regulation. Parts of this resonate, especially the critique that overly restrictive rules can stall innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the chapter underestimates the societal risk of treating real users as test subjects for unproven systems. Benchmarks motivate improvement, but they cannot replace governance.\n",
    "\n",
    "I left more convinced that testing is essential, but equally convinced that testing alone cannot ensure accountability. Without guardrails, iterative deployment becomes mass experimentation.\n",
