    "## A Study That Made Me Uncomfortable\n",
    "\n",
    "I came across a recent MIT Media Lab study examining how AI-assisted writing affects the brain during essay tasks. The findings pushed me to rethink how much I rely on Claude for school, work, and even these posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study followed 54 participants over four months. Some wrote essays with no tools, some used search engines, and others used ChatGPT. EEG measurements revealed something striking: **LLM-assisted writers consistently showed the weakest neural connectivity and lowest cognitive engagement.**\n",

    "## What the Study Found\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cognitive Engagement Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants' neural activity broke down into three clear tiers:\n",
    "- **Brain-only:** strongest, most distributed activation\n",
    "- **Search Engine:** moderate activation\n",
    "- **LLM-assisted:** lowest activation and weakest connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "The more the tool handled the synthesis, the less the brain participated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cognitive Debt Builds Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "After four months, patterns did not converge. If anything, they diverged.\n",
    "\n",
    "When researchers forced participants to switch modes:\n",
    "- **LLM-to-Brain** users struggled to activate core cognitive networks once the AI was removed\n",
    "- **Brain-to-LLM** users still retained higher activation patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors call this **cognitive debt** — a cumulative loss of mental effort that makes it harder to think independently after extended reliance on AI."

    "## The Ownership Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants were asked how much each essay felt like \"their own.\" Results tracked the neural data:\n",
    "- Brain-only: highest sense of ownership\n",
    "- Search Engine: moderate\n",
    "- LLM-assisted: lowest\n",
    "\n",
    "More tellingly, LLM-assisted writers struggled to **quote their own work** later. Because they did not synthesize the ideas themselves, the memory trace was weaker. The AI generated wording; participants just approved it."
