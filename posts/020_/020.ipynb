    "# Your Brain on ChatGPT: The Cost of Cognitive Convenience\n",

    "## A Study That Made Me Uncomfortable\n",
    "I came across MIT Media Lab research on how ChatGPT affects brain activity during essay writing, and it forced me to reflect on my own AI usage.\n",
    "The study tracked 54 participants over four months as they wrote essays using LLMs, search engines, or no tools at all. EEG data showed that LLM users consistently had the weakest neural connectivity.\n"

    "## What the Study Found\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brain Connectivity Differences\n",
    "- **Brain-only:** strongest, most distributed activation\n",
    "- **Search Engine:** moderate engagement\n",
    "- **LLM-assisted:** lowest engagement, minimal connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "The more a tool did the thinking, the less the brain engaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cognitive Debt\n",
    "When participants switched tools:\n",
    "- LLM-to-Brain users struggled to activate key networks\n",
    "- Brain-to-LLM users still showed higher engagement than chronic LLM users\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers called this pattern **cognitive debt**: a downward shift in mental effort that builds up with repeated offloading."

    "- LLM users: lowest\n",
