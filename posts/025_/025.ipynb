    "\n",
    "**It saved time.** Reading three books takes 15-20 hours. Claude summaries took 30 minutes to review.\n",

    "### I Couldn't Remember Anything\n",
    "During the exam, questions asked about specific scenes or character moments. I knew the plot outline but couldn't recall details. My classmates who'd actually read could answer from memory. I was guessing. At the end of the day, I was not really doing the mental/cognitive work of learning the content; of drawing my own conclusions and parallels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I Missed the Tone\n",
    "Claude summarizes *what happens*. It doesn't capture how the writing feels, and the rhetorical choices that come with that. The voice, pacing, style - all gone. For a literature class, that's the entire point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I Didn't Form My Own Interpretations\n",
    "Claude's thematic analysis was correct but generic. Everyone using AI got similar interpretations. My essays sounded like everyone else's because we all used the same summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Lack of Struggle Matters\n",
    "Reading hard books is supposed to be difficult. That difficulty builds comprehension. Summaries skip the work, which means you skip the learning.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Refreshing books you've already read.** If you read it years ago and need a reminder, summaries work fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supplementing, not replacing.** Read the book first, then use AI to clarify confusing sections or organize your notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time triage.** If you're behind and need to prioritize, use AI for secondary readings while focusing deep reading time on primary texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparative analysis.** If you're comparing 10 books and only have time to deeply read 3, summaries can give you enough context for the others.\n"

    "\n",
    "I stopped using Claude for primary readings. If it's assigned, I read it. If I don't have time, I skim the actual book rather than use AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "For secondary sources or background research, AI summaries are fine. But for the main texts in a literature class, there's no shortcut that actually works.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The irony:** Using AI to avoid reading made the class harder, not easier. I spent more time confused during discussions and scrambling during exams than I would have spent just reading.\n",
