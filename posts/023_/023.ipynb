    "\n",
    "For my Marketing and Creativity class, I needed to create advertising concepts for \"Bulby\" - a climate-responsive smart lightbulb. The product isn't real. I needed mockups showing what the campaigns would look like.\n",

    "I used Google DeepMind's Veo to generate the visuals.\n",

    "<img src=\"bulby-advertising.jpg\" alt=\"Bulby Advertising Mockups\" style=\"max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; display: block; margin: 20px auto;\"/>\n"

    "Two campaign concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physical:** Times Square billboard showing \"It's hot, Bulby\" - using extreme heat as contrast to the product's climate awareness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Digital:** Social media ad showing \"It's cold, Bulby\" - clean, modern living room with the lightbulb responding to temperature\n",
    "\n",

    "### Text Rendering\n",
    "Veo can't do text reliably. \"It's hot, Bulby\" came out garbled half the time. I had to regenerate 6-8 times per image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Product Details\n",
    "The lightbulb design kept changing. I needed consistency across campaigns but Veo generated different bulb shapes each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ended up overlaying the same product image manually in post.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brand Consistency\n",
    "Colors, fonts, styling - all inconsistent between generations. AI doesn't understand brand guidelines."
