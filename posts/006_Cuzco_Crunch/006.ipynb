    "## Creating a Brand with AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Eury and I decided to try building a snack brand called Cuzco Crunch, mostly to see how much of the process we could handle using AI tools. We are just experimenting with what's possible when you use GPT for everything from naming to packaging concepts.\n",

    "## What We're Using AI For\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brand Development\n",
    "\n",
    "The name \"Cuzco Crunch\" came from asking GPT to suggest names that sounded distinctive but not too weird. We wanted something that hinted at South American flavors without being too on-the-nose. It generated about 30 options and this one felt right.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Packaging Design Direction\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using AI to create mood boards and design concepts. Instead of hiring a designer upfront, we're generating different packaging styles to see what resonates. The AI helps us think through color schemes, typography, and overall brand personality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Marketing Copy\n",
    "\n",
    "Product descriptions, social media posts, and even this blog post started with AI-generated drafts that we then edited. It's faster than staring at a blank page, and sometimes the AI suggests angles we wouldn't have thought of.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Packaging Concepts](cuzco-crunch-packaging.jpg)\n",
    "*Various packaging design concepts and color schemes*"

    "## What's Working and What Isn't\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Good Stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "Speed is the biggest advantage. We can iterate on ideas quickly without waiting for external feedback or spending money on design consultations. The AI is also good at generating variations - give it one concept and it'll produce 10 different takes on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything needs human editing. The AI-generated copy often sounds too generic or tries too hard to be clever. Design concepts look decent but lack the subtle details that make professional packaging stand out on shelves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the AI doesn't understand practical constraints. It'll suggest elaborate packaging designs that would be expensive to produce or flavors that might not actually taste good together.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Package Mockups](cuzco-crunch-mockups.jpg)\n",
    "*3D mockups and shelf visualization concepts*"

   "source": [
    "## The Reality Check\n",
    "\n",
    "### Still Need Real Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "AI handles the brainstorming and initial concepts, but you still need to understand branding, know your target market, and make business decisions. It's a tool, not a replacement for actual knowledge about building a brand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost vs. Quality Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "We're probably saving money in the early stages, but there's a point where you need professional designers and marketers. The question is finding that sweet spot where AI gets you far enough to make informed decisions about what's worth investing in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "The most valuable part has been understanding how much work goes into brand development. Using AI to handle the repetitive parts lets us focus on strategy and decision-making instead of getting stuck on execution details.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're treating this as an experiment rather than a serious business venture. If Cuzco Crunch turns into something real, great. If not, we've learned a lot about using AI for creative projects and brand development."
