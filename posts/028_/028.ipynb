    "\n",
    "Pages 143-185 of *Superagency* shift from abstract innovation principles to concrete technologies: GPS as informational infrastructure and code as architectural control. Hoffman and Beato argue that AI functions like GPS for language - helping navigate from point A to point B with greater certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chapters made me uncomfortable in a different way than earlier ones. Not because they're wrong, but because they're *persuasive*. I'm starting to see the optimistic case even as I remain skeptical about who benefits.\n"

    "Hoffman highlights that GPS generated $1.4 trillion in economic benefits from 1984 to 2017. The technology emerged from military origins but became publicly accessible infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FCC requirement in the early 2000s - that cell providers must give 911 call centers GPS coordinates - accelerated phone-based GPS adoption. Policy drove technology adoption, which created new possibilities.\n",

    "## The Ability to Get Lost\n",
    "\n",
    "Hoffman asks: \"Do we reduce the scope of human existence by making the world so legible we completely lose our ability to get lost?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This resonated with me more than it should have.\n",
    "\n",

    "But the book is making me ask: what about the flipside? What about the benefits that aren't sellable news stories? History focuses on dramatic failures. Media amplifies fear because it grabs attention.\n",

    "\n",
    "The analogy has limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPS coordinates are objective. Language is not. The \"informational planet\" of each LLM differs based on training data, algorithms, weights, and architectural choices. There's no shared ground truth.\n",

    "GPS works because we agree on latitude and longitude. AI outputs diverge because we don't agree on what language *means*.\n",
