    "## Making Music Without Musical Training\n",
    "\n",
    "For my Marketing 7340 class with Dr. Gideon Nave, I needed to create original music for a Corona ad campaign. The problem: I have no formal music production training. The solution: Suno AI, a tool that generates music from text prompts and voice recordings.\n",
    "\n",
    "I paid $10/month for Suno Pro to test whether AI could actually produce usable marketing music. Here's what happened.\n",

    "## The Assignment: Corona Ad Music\n",
    "\n",
    "**Brief:**\n",
    "- **Concept:** Funky, Latin, afrohouse beat that inspires dancing\n",
    "- **Instruments:** Drums, trumpets, soothing vocals\n",
    "- **Inspiration:** Barry Can't Swim style\n",
    "- **Tempo:** 120-140 BPM\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Corona advertisement\n",
    "- **Mood:** Beach resort, enjoyment, refreshing, sunbathed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lyrics concept:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Chorus]\n",
    "Chasing the sun\n",

    "## How Suno Actually Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### Voice Recording as Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "I started by recording my own voice singing low and high tones. Suno used this as the base vocal texture and extended it into a full track. This \"cover\" feature lets you input raw vocals that the AI then transforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lyrics Generation and Editing\n",
    "\n",
    "Suno has a lyrics generator, but I quickly learned the AI-generated lyrics were generic. I used the generator as a starting point, then heavily edited:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Original AI lyrics:** Standard party/dance themes\n",
    "**My edits (in bold):** Added specific production notes like:\n",
    "- `[Add intense percussion]`\n",
    "- `[Add marimbas and bongos]`\n",
    "- `[Make it hypnotic]`\n",
    "- `[Build anticipation, create anxiety and excitement for the chorus]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Style Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to good output was detailed style prompts:\n",
    "```\n",
    "140bpm. Deephouse, melodic, hypnotic. \n",
    "Add layers of organic, progressive house elements. \n",
    "Add unexpected elements. \n",
    "Use Rufus Du Sol as inspiration.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"suno-editing-interface.jpg\" alt=\"Suno Editing\" style=\"max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; display: block; margin: 20px auto;\"/>\n",

    "## The Iteration Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Attempt: Complete Failure\n",
    "\n",
    "My initial generated song was terrible. The AI-generated lyrics were cliché, the production was muddy, and it didn't capture the vibe I wanted at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What went wrong:**\n",
    "- Generic party lyrics that felt empty\n",
    "- Overproduced sound that lost the organic beach feel\n",
    "- Wrong energy—too aggressive, not relaxed enough\n",
    "\n",
    "I realized I needed to be much more specific in my prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Second Attempt: Rufus Du Sol Inspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "I prompted: \"Change the lyrics to be more Rufus Du Sol-like.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I restructured the entire song with detailed production notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Intro - Another Voice, Raspy Voice]\n",
    "[Add ethereal synths and deep bass]\n",
    "(Ahora)\n",
    "El viaje empieza\n",
    "[Make pause for drop]\n",
    "\n",
    "[Verse 1 - Another Voice, drop here]\n",
    "La atmósfera te abraza, ¿la notas?\n",
    "Fluye conmigo, sin pausa, sin sombras\n",
    "\n",
    "[Another pause, longer]\n",
    "[Build anticipation, create anxiety and excitement \n",
    "for the chorus with drums, marimbas, bongos, and trumpets. \n",
    "Very light instrumental at the beginning.]\n",
    "\n",
    "[Chorus - Main Voice]\n",
    "Let the waves of sound enfold\n",
    "We're captive, our spirits bold\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This version was better. The AI actually responded to the detailed production notes and created more dynamic arrangements.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Listen to the Rufus-inspired version](https://suno.com/s/cVPcEWzySbkOZdG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Third Attempt: Corona Ad Track\n",
    "\n",
    "For the final Corona track, I stripped down the complexity and focused on the beach resort vibe:\n",
    "- Simpler, more direct lyrics about \"chasing the sun\"\n",
    "- Specific instrument calls (trumpets, drums)\n",
    "- Barry Can't Swim inspiration for that organic house feel\n",
    "- Tempo locked at 120-140 BPM\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the most successful version."

    "## What Actually Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specificity in Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Vague prompts like \"make happy music\" produce generic results. Detailed prompts with:\n",
    "- Specific BPM\n",
    "- Named artist references\n",
    "- Exact instruments\n",
    "- Production technique descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "...produce much better output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Notes Within Lyrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The bracketed production notes `[Add trumpet solo]` or `[Build anticipation]` actually work. Suno interprets these and adjusts the arrangement accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Voice Input as Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "Recording my own voice gave the track a unique texture. Even though the AI heavily processed it, there's something more authentic than purely synthetic vocals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iteration Is Essential\n",
    "\n",
    "The first output is never good. You need multiple generations, tweaking prompts each time based on what worked and what didn't."

    "## Serious Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lack of Fine Control\n",
    "\n",
    "You can suggest instruments and styles, but you can't control:\n",
    "- Exact timing of drops or builds\n",
    "- Precise mixing levels\n",
    "- Specific chord progressions\n",
    "- Individual track editing\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Inconsistent Output Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with the same prompt, Suno generates wildly different results. Sometimes it nails the vibe, sometimes it completely misses. You're rolling the dice each generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generic Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite specific prompts, certain elements always sound \"AI-generated\":\n",
    "- Vocal processing has a distinctive Suno quality\n",
    "- Transitions can feel abrupt or unnatural\n",
    "- Complex arrangements often get muddied\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limited Musical Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Suno doesn't understand music theory deeply. If you ask for a specific harmonic progression or complex rhythmic pattern, it might approximate but not execute precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Copyright and Licensing Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "For a real commercial project (like an actual Corona ad), there are murky questions:\n",
    "- Who owns the rights to AI-generated music?\n",
    "- Can you legally use Suno output in paid advertising?\n",
    "- What happens if the AI \"learned\" from copyrighted material?\n",

    "- Faster generation times\n",

    "### For This Assignment: Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "For a marketing class project where I needed original music quickly, $10 was worth it. The alternative would be:\n",
    "- Learning actual music production (months/years)\n",
    "- Hiring a producer ($hundreds to $thousands)\n",
    "- Using stock music (doesn't fit specific brief)\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Serious Music Production: No\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're actually trying to produce professional music, Suno is a novelty, not a tool. The limitations are too significant, and the output quality isn't competitive with human-produced tracks.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suno is best for:\n",
    "- Rapid prototyping of musical ideas\n",
    "- Creating placeholder tracks for projects\n",
    "- Generating inspiration for actual musicians\n",
    "- Quick demos for pitches or presentations\n",

    "### Quality vs. Cost Tradeoff\n",

    "- Pitch decks\n",
    "- Testing concepts before investing in production\n",

    "\n",
    "### Professional Musicians' Concern\n",
    "\n",
    "From a music industry perspective, tools like Suno are concerning. If brands can generate \"good enough\" music for $10/month, that undercuts professional composers and producers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The counterargument: truly great music still requires human creativity, and AI tools might just handle the low-end market that wasn't hiring professionals anyway."

    "## Final Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "Suno AI successfully generated usable music for my marketing class project. The Corona ad track captured the beach resort vibe and had the right energy for the brief.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the process revealed clear limitations:\n",
    "- Heavy iteration required (first attempts were unusable)\n",
    "- Lack of fine control over production elements\n",
    "- Output has distinctive \"AI\" quality\n",
    "- Not suitable for professional commercial use\n",
    "\n",
    "**For class projects and rapid prototyping:** Suno is genuinely useful. It lets you explore musical ideas quickly without technical skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For real marketing campaigns:** You'd still want a human producer. The AI can generate ideas or placeholder tracks, but the final product needs human refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $10/month was worth it for this specific use case, but I'm canceling the subscription after the project ends. It's a tool I needed temporarily, not something I'd use regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly: AI music generation is impressive technically, but it highlights what human musicians bring—intentionality, emotional depth, and creative choices that respond to cultural context in ways algorithms can't replicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Corona ad track works for a student project. But Corona the actual company? They're still hiring real composers."
