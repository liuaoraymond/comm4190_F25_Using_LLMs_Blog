    "\n",
    "This section of *Superagency* (pages 99–143) shifts from optimism to mechanics: how testing, benchmarking, and iterative competition supposedly form the backbone of American AI leadership. Hoffman and Beato frame this as a uniquely democratic innovation engine. Parts of the chapter are compelling; others amplify the same concerns raised earlier in the book.\n",

    "The real tension is not democracy vs. authoritarianism; it's **permissionless innovation vs. burden-of-proof safety models.** For frontier AI, neither extreme may work. The chapter sidesteps how high-risk technologies challenge this binary."

    "\n",
    "The analogy to the Ford assembly line captures both sides. It democratized mobility while creating decades of infrastructural and environmental dependencies. Innovation often hides long-tail costs that appear only after widespread deployment."

    "Chapter 5 argues that testing can replace regulation, accelerating safe innovation. The idea has merit—overly strict regulation can freeze progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the chapter underestimates what happens when testing becomes a governance substitute. Benchmarks become branding exercises. Users become test subjects. Accountability evaporates.\n",
