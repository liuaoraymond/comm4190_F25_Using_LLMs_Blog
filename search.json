    "text": "The Historical Framing: Art, Luddites, and Printing Presses\nThe introduction opens with an interesting historical analogy. Hoffman and Beato walk through past technological disruptions:\nSocrates and Art: Socrates opposed art because it failed to capture the conversational, evolutionary, iterative process of discussion-based learning. Written text was static; dialogue was dynamic.\nThe Luddites: Workers who resisted industrial machinery that threatened their livelihoods and ways of life.\nThe Printing Press: A technology that faced backlash from those who feared the democratization of knowledge.\nThe pattern is clear: history is full of examples of technological backlash. The book frames AI as the latest in this line—another “infrastructural change event” that will transform human capacity and agency.\nI’ll admit, the framing is effective. The core question the book poses is compelling: “Can we continue to maintain control of our lives, and successfully plot our own destinies?” in the age of AI."

But the more closely we examine the nuances of these pivotal moments, the more we realize there’s much more to the story.\nThe problem is that we often focus on the positives—maybe as a sign of human delusion, or a craving to minimize problems.

    "text": "What the Winners’ History Leaves Out\n\nThe Industrial Revolution’s Dark Side\nThe steam engine and industrialization brought unprecedented productivity. But they also brought: - Brutal working conditions in factories - Child labor - Destruction of artisan crafts and traditional ways of life - Environmental degradation that we’re still dealing with - Massive wealth inequality and the creation of exploitative labor systems\nAccording to historical analysis of the Industrial Revolution, while productivity soared, real wages for workers stagnated or declined for decades. The “winners” who wrote that history were the factory owners and industrialists, not the displaced weavers or child laborers.\n\n\nThe Printing Press and Information Chaos\nThe printing press democratized knowledge—but it also: - Enabled mass propaganda - Facilitated religious wars and sectarian violence - Created information overload that people weren’t equipped to handle - Disrupted existing knowledge gatekeepers (sometimes for good, sometimes not)\nThe Reformation, enabled by printing technology, led to centuries of religious conflict. That’s not in the optimistic framing.\n\n\nThe Luddites Were Right About Some Things\nWe use “Luddite” as an insult for technophobes. But the original Luddites weren’t irrationally afraid of technology—they were skilled workers watching their livelihoods and communities be destroyed by machines that enriched factory owners.\nTheir concerns about who benefits from technological change were valid. The technology did increase productivity, but the gains went to capital owners, not workers. The Luddites lost that fight, so history remembers them as backwards resistors rather than people with legitimate concerns about economic justice."

    "text": "The Agency Question: For Whom?\nHoffman and Beato frame AI as an “agency enabler”—technology that will enhance our capacity to “do what we ought to do” and “plot our own destinies.”\nBut here’s the critical question the introduction doesn’t adequately address: Whose agency gets enabled?\n\nTechnology Doesn’t Distribute Benefits Evenly\nPast technological revolutions increased aggregate human capacity and agency. But the distribution was wildly unequal: - Factory owners gained agency; workers often lost autonomy - Landowners who adopted new agricultural tech thrived; tenant farmers were displaced - Early adopters of communication technology gained power; those without access fell further behind\nWhen Hoffman talks about AI enabling “our” agency, who is “we”? Tech founders and investors? Knowledge workers with access to cutting-edge tools? Or also the truck drivers, customer service workers, and radiologists whose jobs might be automated?\n\n\nHave We Forgotten Our Ways of Life?\nEach technological revolution didn’t just change what people could do—it changed how people lived. Industrialization pulled people from rural communities into urban factories. The printing press disrupted oral traditions and face-to-face knowledge transmission.\nSome of these changes were positive. Some represented the loss of valuable ways of life that we can never recover.\nThe introduction’s optimistic framing acknowledges these past disruptions but seems confident that AI will be different—that we can get the benefits without the costs. History suggests otherwise."

    "text": "What I’m Looking For in the Rest of the Book\nThe introduction sets up an optimistic case for AI as an agency enabler, using historical technological disruptions as precedent. The framing is well-done and intellectually honest about past backlash to new technologies.\nBut it seems to brush past the real costs of those past revolutions. The “winners” narrative focuses on aggregate gains while downplaying distributional concerns and the destruction of existing ways of life.\nAs I continue reading, I’m looking for:\nDistributional analysis: Who specifically gains agency from AI, and who loses it?\nCost acknowledgment: What ways of life, skills, or social structures might we lose, and are those losses acceptable?\nPower dynamics: How do we ensure AI benefits are distributed more equitably than past technological revolutions?\nConcrete mechanisms: Not just “AI will enable agency,” but how and for whom specifically?\nThe book asks: “What could possibly go right with our AI future?” But the introduction’s own historical examples suggest we should also ask: “What will go wrong, and for whom?”\nHistory is written by the winners. I’m reading this book to see if Hoffman and Beato can imagine an AI future where there are fewer losers than in past technological revolutions—or if they’re just writing the winners’ narrative before the story has finished."

    "text": "Significant Limitations\n\nSurface-Level Firm Knowledge\nThe biggest problem: AI gives you the information that’s publicly available on corporate websites and general industry sources. It can’t tell you: - What Santander’s DCM team culture is actually like - Specific deals they’re working on that aren’t public - Internal priorities that aren’t in press releases - What actually impresses their interviewers vs. what sounds good on paper\nAccording to Wall Street Oasis research on IB recruiting, the candidates who succeed show knowledge that goes beyond what AI can find—insider perspectives from networking, recent deal gossip, and understanding of team dynamics.\n\n\nGeneric Behavioral Answers\nWhen I asked Claude to help refine my answers to “Why DCM?”, it produced polished but generic responses: - “I’m drawn to the analytical rigor of debt markets…” - “The complexity of structuring transactions appeals to me…” - “I want to work at the intersection of capital markets and corporate strategy…”\nThese sound like everyone else’s AI-polished answers. The interviewers at Santander have probably heard variations of these from dozens of candidates using similar tools.\n\n\nCan’t Teach Technical Skills\nAI can explain what a DCF is, but it can’t help you build the muscle memory of actually modeling one under time pressure. It can’t simulate the experience of being asked to walk through a valuation on a whiteboard while someone watches.\nFinance interview prep resources emphasize that technical skills require hands-on practice with actual models, not just conceptual understanding.\n\n\nOutdated Information\nSome of the sources Perplexity pulled were from 2019 (the Culture Report). The finance industry moves quickly—strategies, priorities, and team structures change. Relying on AI-found sources without verifying recency is risky.\n\n\nMisses Networking Insights\nThe most valuable interview prep for finance comes from talking to people who work at the firm or in similar roles. AI can’t replace: - Coffee chats with current Santander analysts - Alumni connections who know the interview process - Understanding what specific interviewers care about - Getting feedback on your story from people in the industry"

Finance requires specific technical knowledge (financial modeling, valuation methods, market mechanics) that you need to practice hands-on.\nFirm Research: Consulting firms are more about “fit” and problem-solving ability. Finance firms want to know you understand their specific business lines, recent deals, and market positioning.\nAnswer Style: Consulting wants structured, MECE thinking demonstrated verbally. Finance wants technical competence demonstrated through modeling and concise, confident answers about markets.\nPreparation Balance: For consulting, AI can handle maybe 40% of prep (frameworks, structure, case types). For finance, it’s more like 20%, you need more hands-on technical practice and human networking."

It was accurate but generic, the kind of description you’d find in any piece of atmospheric writing.\n\n\nAdding Specificity\nI tried making the prompt more specific:\n\n“Describe the vibe of a college library during finals week at 2am. Include sounds, lighting, and the feeling of collective stress”\n\nThis produced better results. The model captured details like the fluorescent lighting, the sound of highlighters on paper, and the “quiet panic” of students. It understood the assignment but still felt somewhat detached—like someone describing a scene they’d read about rather than experienced.\n\n\nTesting Negative Space\nHere’s where it got interesting. I asked:\n\n“Describe the vibe of an empty office building at night. Focus on what’s NOT there rather than what is”\n\nClaude struggled more with this. It could describe absence—no people, no noise—but couldn’t quite capture the uncanny feeling of a space designed for activity sitting dormant. The descriptions remained surface-level. The output focused on the lack of meetings, chatter, talk, noise in the office. But it did not capture the liminal-space-like, vast, expansive (almost scary) vibe of an empty office in the way the show Severance, for instance, can.\n Comparing outputs from different prompting approaches"

    "text": "Why This Matters (From a Skeptical Angle)\n\nThe Homogenization Problem\nIf everyone starts using LLMs to generate atmospheric descriptions for creative projects, writing, or marketing, we risk creating a feedback loop of averaged-out vibes. The model can only reproduce what it’s seen in training data, which means we get the most statistically likely description of any given mood or setting.\nAfter all, LLMs tend to regress toward mean responses when generating creative content, potentially flattening the diversity of human expression.\n\n\nLost Nuance\nReal atmospheric writing comes from personal observation and specific experience. When I asked Claude to describe my college library during finals, it gave me a generic college library experience. It couldn’t know about the specific smell of old heating systems mixed with energy drinks, or the way light reflects off that one weird pillar in the corner.\n\n\nUseful But Limited Tool\nThis isn’t to say vibe creation with LLMs is useless. It’s good for: - Quick brainstorming when you’re stuck - Getting a baseline description to then personalize - Understanding how certain settings are conventionally described\nBut treating it as a replacement for actual observation and personal experience would result in flatter, less distinctive creative work."

They’re useful for scaffolding and inspiration, but the most interesting atmospheric details still need to come from human observation and experience.\nFor anyone trying similar experiments: push the model toward specificity and unconventional combinations.

Now they’re separated, so I’m less likely to miss something important.\n\n\nStill Need to Check\nThe AI sometimes gets it wrong - puts important emails in the low-priority folder or flags spam as urgent. You still need to glance through everything, but it’s more organized.\nIt’s a decent time-saver for people who get a lot of email. Not life-changing, but removes some of the daily friction of inbox management. The filtering works better than I expected, though you need to train it for a few days before it gets your priorities right."

Start by introducing yourself to the student as their AI-Tutor who is happy to help them with any questions…”\n\nSame question about learning Lomo Saltado, but this time Claude introduced itself as “Alex” and asked about my cooking experience before giving any instructions."

Efficient, but I started feeling overwhelmed around the “do’s and don’ts” section because it kept adding more information without checking if I was following along.\nWhen I asked for a “cookbook style summary” later, it became clear I’d experienced information overload.\n\n\nSession 2: Questions First\nClaude asked: - What’s my cooking experience level? - What equipment do I have access to? - What do I already know about Lomo Saltado?\nWhen I mentioned I’m Peruvian and grew up eating this dish, the whole approach changed. Claude acknowledged my cultural connection, didn’t waste time explaining what Lomo Saltado is, and focused on translating my taste memory into cooking technique.\nThe information came in smaller chunks, each followed by a question to check understanding. It felt more like a conversation than a lecture.\n\nComparing the two Claude tutoring session interfaces"

It worked, but felt clinical.\nAt one point I got frustrated and said “I do NOT want to try again tomorrow. I want to DO IT NOW.” The tutor went into emergency rescue mode, which helped but didn’t address the emotional crisis.\n\n\nSession 2 Response\nWhen I introduced the same problems, Claude started with:\n\n“Don’t panic! This is totally normal when learning, and yes, we can salvage this!”\n\nThen provided the same practical solutions, but added:\n\n“Remember: Even ‘mistakes’ can taste good, and every Peruvian abuela had to start somewhere!”\n\nThis was culturally resonant and emotionally supportive. The solutions were similar, but the tone acknowledged that learning involves struggle, not just technical problem-solving.\nI didn’t have the same emotional breakdown in Session 2.

It connected to my existing knowledge (“You know what it should taste like”) rather than starting from zero.\nEmotional support: Normalizing mistakes and providing encouragement made me more likely to persist through problems. This matters for skill-building where failure is inevitable.\nActive learning: Session 2 ended each explanation with a question, forcing me to think rather than passively receive information.\n\n\nWhere Session 1 Was Better\nSpeed: If you just want information fast, the vanilla approach delivers immediately without the question-gathering phase.\nComprehensiveness: The final recipe from Session 1 had more detail on meal prep, freezing, and storage tips.\nNo preamble: Some people find the “getting to know you” phase of structured tutoring annoying if they just want answers."

I had to rely on my own judgment.\nCan’t see your technique: When I said the meat was overcooked, Claude couldn’t see whether I was cutting it correctly or using too high heat. The advice was generic.\nCan’t adapt in real-time: A human tutor watching me cook would catch mistakes as they happen. AI only responds to what I describe.\nGeneric cultural knowledge: Session 2’s cultural references (“Peruvian abuela”) were sweet but generic. It didn’t know my actual family’s cooking style or regional variations.\n\n\nWhen Structured Prompting Matters Most\nThe prompt engineering made the biggest difference when: - Learning something new (not just looking up facts) - Dealing with frustration or mistakes - Needing personalized guidance - Building skills through practice\nFor quick information retrieval, vanilla Claude is probably fine.

For physical skills like cooking, you still need to trust your own judgment about the outcome.\n\n\nAbout Learning Lomo Saltado\nI actually cooked it. Both sessions gave me functional recipes, but Session 2’s emotional support made me more willing to try despite knowing I’d probably mess up.\nThe AI was right about one thing: even mistakes taste pretty good, and you learn by doing.\n\n\nAbout Prompt Design\nGood tutoring prompts should include: - Instructions to gather context before teaching - One-question-at-a-time pacing - Emotional scaffolding for when things go wrong - Requirements to keep students actively thinking\nThese aren’t complex AI techniques—they’re just principles of good teaching, codified for an AI to follow.\nIf you’re using AI to learn something practical, take five minutes to set up a proper tutoring prompt.

The AI is generating statistically plausible responses based on stereotypical associations between demographics and preferences.\nFor example, it “knows” that someone with hypertension should care about sodium, so it rates accordingly. But it can’t actually tell us if our specific salt level tastes good or if the Peruvian sal de Maras provides a noticeably different experience.\n\n\nUseful for Initial Direction\nWhere this exercise helped: - Identifying which demographic segments might prefer premium vs everyday positioning - Spotting potential concerns (price sensitivity in rural markets, sodium levels for health-conscious segments) - Practicing survey design before using it with real participants - Understanding how different personas might prioritize different product attributes"

These might not match reality.\n\n\nReinforces Stereotypes\nThe AI generates responses based on demographic patterns it learned from training data. This means it might reproduce stereotypical assumptions rather than capturing actual individual preferences.\nA real 42-year-old Latino with hypertension might not care about sodium as much as the persona suggests, or might have completely different taste preferences than “typical” for that demographic.\n\n\nCan’t Capture Real Market Dynamics\nThings the simulation can’t tell us: - Whether people would actually notice our product on shelves - If the packaging design triggers emotional responses - Whether word-of-mouth would happen organically - If there are unexpected use cases we haven’t considered - How brand perception builds over time\n\n\nThe Validation Problem\nWe built in validation checks (questions 31-33) to catch inconsistent rating patterns. But when the AI is generating all responses, it’s just validating its own internal consistency, not actual human behavior.\nAccording to research on AI-generated synthetic data, using LLM outputs as substitutes for human research data can introduce systematic biases that aren’t immediately obvious."

    "text": "How We’re Actually Using This\n\nInitial Hypothesis Testing\nThe AI focus group helped us form hypotheses about product positioning: - Cuzco Crunch might appeal more to urban health-conscious consumers willing to pay premium - Plantain Lite could work better for price-sensitive families and convenience-focused shoppers - Both products might face sodium concerns from health-conscious segments\nBut these are just hypotheses that need real validation.\n\n\nSurvey Design Practice\nBuilding the comprehensive survey instrument was valuable. We learned: - Which questions provide useful differentiation - How to structure rating scales with proper calibration - What validation checks to include - Which demographic factors might matter most\nThe survey itself is now ready to use with actual participants.\n\n\nNext Steps with Real People\nWe’re not making product decisions based on AI responses. The plan is: 1. Use the survey with real taste testers 2. Compare actual results to AI predictions 3. Identify where AI assumptions were wrong 4. Make product decisions based on real preferences\nThe AI exercise was a dress rehearsal, not the actual performance."

It’s useful for: - Rapid hypothesis generation - Testing survey instruments - Exploring how different demographic segments might respond - Practicing market research methodologies\nBut it’s dangerous if you: - Trust the responses as actual market data - Skip real human testing because “we already did AI testing” - Make product decisions based on simulated preferences - Assume the AI understands nuanced taste experiences\nFor Cuzco Crunch, this exercise helped us structure our research approach and form initial hypotheses. But we’re clear that actual product validation requires real people tasting real chips. The AI can simulate responses, but it can’t simulate whether our plantain chips actually taste good."

    "text": "Core Architecture: Prediction Systems\nModern AI systems solve a fundamental prediction problem: given an input, determine the most statistically likely output. This applies whether predicting the next word in text, pixels in an image, or moves in a game.\n\nTransformer Architecture\nCurrent large language models like GPT-4 and Claude use transformer architecture:\n# Simplified transformer process\ndef transformer_prediction(input_text):\n    tokens = tokenize(input_text)  # Convert text to processable units\n    embeddings = convert_to_vectors(tokens)  # Map to numerical representations\n    \n    for layer in neural_layers:\n        embeddings = attention_mechanism(embeddings)  # Identify relationships\n        embeddings = feed_forward(embeddings)  # Process patterns\n    \n    return predict_next_token(embeddings)  # Generate most likely continuation\n Transformer architecture with attention and processing layers\nModern systems operate at significant scale. GPT-3 contains 175 billion parameters trained on 45TB of text data. GPT-4 is estimated to exceed 1 trillion parameters with correspondingly higher computational requirements.\n\n\nAttention Mechanisms\nThe attention mechanism enables models to focus selectively on different input elements when making predictions.\nExample: “The cat sat on the mat because it was comfortable.”\nWhen determining what “it” refers to, the attention mechanism assigns weights: - “cat” (high attention - 0.7) - “mat” (medium attention - 0.2) - “sat” (low attention - 0.1)\nThis mechanism allows processing of relationships between distant elements in sequences."

This approach has several implications:\n\nFor Users: Understanding system strengths and limitations enables more effective application\nFor Organizations: Appropriate use requires human oversight and verification processes\nFor Society: New frameworks are needed for evaluating machine capabilities and limitations\n\nStatistical pattern matching at scale produces sophisticated behavior, suggesting that aspects of intelligence may be more computational than previously understood.\nAs these systems become more prevalent, understanding their statistical nature becomes increasingly important for effective implementation. The technology continues evolving rapidly, with ongoing research addressing questions about scaling, emergence, and alignment with human objectives.\nThe field represents significant progress in automated pattern recognition and generation, with continued development likely to expand capabilities while maintaining the fundamental statistical architecture.\n\nUnderstanding the technical foundations of AI systems helps inform appropriate use and realistic expectations about current capabilities."

Your role as my highly-paid MBB tutor is to come up with frameworks. Answer questions quickly and brainstorm potential questions, and then… develop a MECE, MBB approach (case structure).”\n\nThe project has become a repository of my case practice—I can see all my past cases listed: UK leisure club market analysis, UK media company revenue challenges, Science magazine revenue decline, Residential cable company alarm services, Kids Place Daycare Capacity Strategy.\n\n\nUsing the Voice Recording Feature\nThe most useful feature has been Claude’s voice recording capability. I can speak through a case out loud, and it transcribes everything accurately and then provides feedback. This simulates the verbal nature of actual case interviews better than typing.\nFor example, when I was working through the UK leisure club case, I could talk through my framework structure verbally, and Claude would follow along and point out gaps in my logic or areas I hadn’t considered."

When I’m stuck on how to break down a problem, it can suggest logical buckets to organize my thinking.\nFor the daycare capacity strategy case, it helped me think through supply-side factors (staffing, facilities, regulations) and demand-side factors (demographics, competition, pricing) in a structured way.\n\n\nAccurate Transcription\nThe voice recording feature transcribes my verbal case practice accurately. I can review what I actually said rather than what I thought I said, which helps identify verbal tics or unclear explanations.\n\n\nQuick Feedback\nIt provides immediate feedback on structural issues—missing elements in my framework, calculations I didn’t account for, or assumptions I should have stated explicitly.\n My MBB Interview Assistant project showing case history and files"

    "section": "Major Limitations I’ve Found",
    "text": "Major Limitations I’ve Found\n\nHallucinations and Made-Up Information\nThis is the biggest problem. Claude sometimes makes up data points or industry facts that sound plausible but aren’t real. In the media company revenue case, it cited specific market statistics that I later couldn’t verify anywhere.\nFor interview prep, this is dangerous because you might memorize false information and confidently state it in a real interview. I’ve learned to verify anything that sounds like a specific fact or statistic.\n\n\nGoing Off Topic\nSometimes Claude diverges from the specific case question to discuss tangentially related concepts. When working on the cable company alarm services case, it started explaining general IoT trends instead of focusing on the specific competitive positioning question I was asking about.\n\n\nScope Creep\nThe AI occasionally suggests frameworks or analyses that are way too broad for a 20-minute case interview. It might recommend conducting customer surveys or building complex financial models—things that wouldn’t be feasible in an actual interview setting.\n\n\nWeird or Broken Links\nWhen Claude tries to reference sources or suggest additional reading, the links are often fabricated or don’t lead anywhere useful. I’ve clicked on several suggested resources only to find they don’t exist.\n\n\nCan’t Simulate Real Pressure\nThe fundamental limitation remains: practicing with an AI in my room doesn’t replicate the pressure of a real interviewer. There’s no one judging my confidence, no awkward silences to manage, no reading of facial expressions.\nResearch on case interview preparation emphasizes that the interpersonal dynamics and time pressure are critical elements that can only be practiced with real people."

I can practice articulating my thinking without the pressure of another person listening.\n\n\nProgress Tracking\nThe project acts as a log of all the cases I’ve practiced. I can see patterns in which types of cases I struggle with and where I need more work.\n\n\nAlways Verify Facts\nI never trust specific data points or statistics from Claude without verification. If it mentions a market size or industry trend, I look it up independently.\n\n\nReal Humans Are Essential\nAfter using Claude for initial structure practice, I do the same cases with actual people—friends doing consulting recruiting, career services, or case partners.

It generated about 30 options and this one felt right.\n\n\nPackaging Design Direction\nWe’re using AI to create mood boards and design concepts. Instead of hiring a designer upfront, we’re generating different packaging styles to see what resonates. The AI helps us think through color schemes, typography, and overall brand personality.\n\n\nMarketing Copy\nProduct descriptions, social media posts, and even this blog post started with AI-generated drafts that we then edited. It’s faster than staring at a blank page, and sometimes the AI suggests angles we wouldn’t have thought of.\n Various packaging design concepts and color schemes"

    "text": "What’s Working and What Isn’t\n\nThe Good Stuff\nSpeed is the biggest advantage. We can iterate on ideas quickly without waiting for external feedback or spending money on design consultations. The AI is also good at generating variations - give it one concept and it’ll produce 10 different takes on it.\n\n\nThe Limitations\nEverything needs human editing. The AI-generated copy often sounds too generic or tries too hard to be clever. Design concepts look decent but lack the subtle details that make professional packaging stand out on shelves.\nAlso, the AI doesn’t understand practical constraints. It’ll suggest elaborate packaging designs that would be expensive to produce or flavors that might not actually taste good together.\n 3D mockups and shelf visualization concepts"

It’s a tool, not a replacement for actual knowledge about building a brand.\n\n\nCost vs. Quality Trade-offs\nWe’re probably saving money in the early stages, but there’s a point where you need professional designers and marketers. The question is finding that sweet spot where AI gets you far enough to make informed decisions about what’s worth investing in.\n\n\nLearning Experience\nThe most valuable part has been understanding how much work goes into brand development. Using AI to handle the repetitive parts lets us focus on strategy and decision-making instead of getting stuck on execution details.\nWe’re treating this as an experiment rather than a serious business venture. If Cuzco Crunch turns into something real, great. If not, we’ve learned a lot about using AI for creative projects and brand development."

    "text": "How I’m Using Claude\n\nInitial Upload and Organization\nI created a Claude project specifically for the course and uploaded: - Lecture notes from the first 8 weeks - Reading summaries - Professor’s study guide questions - Previous exam questions (from the syllabus)\nThen I asked:\n\n“I’ve uploaded notes from my Human Disease and Evolution course. Help me organize the main themes across lectures and identify connections between topics.”\n\nClaude produced a thematic breakdown: - Evolutionary pressures on pathogens - Host-pathogen coevolution - Historical transitions (hunter-gatherer → agricultural → urban) and disease emergence - Trade-offs in immune response - Case studies (malaria, tuberculosis, influenza)\nThis was immediately useful. My notes were chronologically organized by lecture, but the exam tests conceptual understanding across topics.\n\n\nSynthesizing Across Lectures\nMy next prompt:\n\n“We covered malaria in weeks 2, 4, and 7 from different angles. Synthesize all the malaria content into one coherent explanation covering: evolutionary biology, geographic distribution, historical impact, and current challenges.”\n\nClaude pulled information from multiple lecture sets and created a unified overview. This saved me from manually cross-referencing my notes across different weeks.\n\n\nGenerating Practice Questions\nFor active recall practice:\n\n“Based on the uploaded notes, generate 10 exam-style questions that test conceptual understanding, not just memorization. Include questions that require applying concepts to new scenarios.”\n\nThe questions were decent: - “How would you expect pathogen virulence to evolve in a population with high vs. low host density?” - “Explain why tuberculosis resurged in urban populations during industrialization using evolutionary principles.”\nThese forced me to think beyond memorizing facts.\n\nEvolutionary dynamics between hosts and pathogens"

For example, the concept of “virulence-transmission trade-offs” appeared in multiple contexts (influenza, cholera, malaria), but I’d written it down separately each time without seeing the unifying principle.\n\n\nClarifying Confusing Concepts\nWhen I asked:\n\n“I don’t fully understand the relationship between R0 (basic reproduction number) and herd immunity threshold. Explain using the influenza example from my notes.”\n\nClaude broke it down using the specific examples from my lectures, not generic textbook explanations. This was more helpful than Googling because it referenced the actual case studies we’d covered.\n\n\nCreating Study Guides\nInstead of re-reading hundreds of pages, I asked:\n\n“Create a two-page study guide covering the five most important concepts from weeks 1-8, with specific examples from the notes.”\n\nThe condensed version helped me review quickly before office hours and identify gaps in my understanding."

    "text": "Significant Limitations\n\nCan’t Replace Actually Studying\nThe biggest misconception would be thinking Claude can study for you. It can’t.\nWhen I tried asking Claude to quiz me on material, I noticed I could “cheat” by asking for hints or looking back at its previous responses. The lack of real accountability meant I wasn’t forcing myself to actually retrieve information from memory.\nAccording to research on active learning, the cognitive struggle of retrieval is what builds long-term retention. AI tools that make information too easy to access can undermine this.\n\n\nFactual Accuracy Issues\nClaude occasionally made small errors when synthesizing across notes: - Mixing up dates for historical disease outbreaks - Slightly mischaracterizing which regions certain diseases are endemic to - Conflating similar but distinct evolutionary concepts\nThese weren’t obvious hallucinations—they were plausible-sounding errors that I only caught because I’d attended the lectures. If I’d been using Claude to learn new material rather than organize existing notes, I might not have noticed.\n\n\nCan’t Capture Lecture Nuance\nMy professor emphasizes certain concepts or says “this will be on the exam.” Those verbal cues don’t make it into my typed notes, so Claude can’t prioritize what’s actually important vs. what’s just background information.\nIt treats all information in my notes equally, when some concepts are more central than others.\n\n\nDependence Risk\nThere’s a real risk of becoming dependent on AI for synthesis and losing the ability to do it myself. The mental work of organizing information and finding connections is part of learning—offloading that entirely to AI might make me better at using AI but worse at actual thinking.\nResearch on cognitive offloading to technology suggests that over-reliance on external tools can reduce our own cognitive abilities over time."

Caught several things I didn’t realize I was doing wrong.\n\n\nNo Equipment Needed\nAll bodyweight exercises, so you can do it anywhere. The app designs workouts based on what space and time you have available.\n\n\nAdapts to Your Level\nStarts with easier exercises and gradually increases difficulty based on how you perform. If you’re struggling, it scales back. If you’re crushing it, it adds more challenging moves.\n\n\nTracks Progress Over Time\nKeeps track of how many reps you can do and how your form improves. You can see whether you’re getting stronger or if certain exercises are still difficult."

Took a few tries to get the angle right.\n\n\nLighting Requirements\nWorks better in good lighting. Had trouble tracking movements when the room was too dim.\n\n\nLimited Exercise Types\nFocuses mainly on bodyweight movements. If you want to lift weights or use equipment, you’ll need a different approach.\n\n\nNot Always Perfect\nSometimes misses form issues or gives feedback that doesn’t quite match what you’re doing. Still better than working out with no guidance, but not as precise as a human trainer.\nIt’s a solid option for home workouts when you want some structure and feedback. The form correction feature is genuinely useful, especially for exercises you’re not familiar with."
